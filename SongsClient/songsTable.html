What's your name?  \nAnd what do you know?\"  \n  \nIn blood and death 'neath a screaming sky  \nI lay down on the ground.  \nThe arms and legs of other men  \nWere scattered all around.  \nSome prayed and cursed, then cursed and prayed  \nAnd then they prayed some more.  \nAnd the only thing that I could see,  \nWas a pair of brown eyes they were looking at me.  \nWhen we got back, labeled parts one to three,  \nThere was no fairer brown eyes waiting for me.  \n  \nAnd a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  \nA rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  \nAnd a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  \nFor a pair of brown eyes,  \nFor a pair of brown eyes.  \n  \nI looked at him he looked at me,  \nAll I could do was hate him.  \nWhile Ray and Philomena sang,  \nOf my elusive dream.  \nI saw the streams and the rolling hills,  \nWhere his brown eyes were waiting.  \nAnd I thought about a pair of brown eyes,  \nThat waited once for me,  \nThat waited once for me.  \n  \nSo drunk as hell I left the place,  \nSometimes walking, sometimes crawling.  \nA hungry sound came through the breeze,  \nSo I gave the walls a talking.  \nAnd I heard the sounds of long ago,  \nFrom the old canal.  \nAnd the birds were whistling in the trees,  \nWhere the wind was gently laughing.  \n  \nAnd a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  \nA rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  \nAnd a rovin' a rovin' a rovin' I'll go,  \nFor a pair of brown eyes,  \nFor a pair of brown eyes.\n\n",

What a Christmas to remember  \n  \nStrangers when we met, lovers as we leave  \nChristmas to remember, too good to believe  \nDon't know how or when, but I know we'll meet again  \nWe'll come blowin' back to somewhere like some wild restless winter's wind  \n  \nAnd you've made this a Christmas to remember  \nSpringtime feelin's in the middle of December  \nNeath the mistletoe you kissed me warm and tender  \nOh! What a Christmas to remember  \n  \nWe loved and laughed and played and joked  \nSang Christmas songs and talked to folks  \nSleighed the fields and skied the slopes  \nThen to the lodge for dinner  \nBut now it's time for us to go  \nAs our hearts melt like chimney snow  \nThere's just one thing I want to know  \nCan we do this next winter  \nOh! What a Christmas to remember  \n  \nYou've made this a Christmas to remember  \nSpringtime feelin's in the middle of December  \nThough the fire is hot, we'll just have to let it simmer  \nOh! What a Christmas to remember  \n  \nYou've made this a Christmas to remember  \nSpringtime feelin's in the middle of December  \nThough it's cold outside we'll just stroke the burning embers  \nOh!
